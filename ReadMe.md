# NLP + Data Science Projects (Gonzaga University – CPSC 475)

This repository showcases a series of NLP and data science projects completed for **CPSC 475: Natural Language Processing** at Gonzaga University.  
It includes both traditional statistical techniques (TF-IDF, entropy, word vectors) and deep learning models (Transformers built from scratch).

> 🔬 Built for employers and researchers seeking candidates with hands-on experience in modern NLP methods, machine learning foundations, and end-to-end model implementation.

## 📁 Project Highlights

### 🧮 Homework 1–2: TF-IDF & Entropy  
- Implemented Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency manually  
- Calculated document-level entropy for word importance  
- Applied statistical techniques to rank relevant terms  

### 🧠 Homework 4–5: Parse Trees & Word Vectors  
- Constructed constituency parse trees using recursive grammar rules  
- Generated basic word vectors and applied cosine similarity  
- Explored semantics in vector space models  

### ⚙️ Homework 7–13: Transformer from Scratch  
- Implemented a complete Transformer architecture step-by-step:
  - Positional encoding  
  - Scaled dot-product attention  
  - Multi-head attention  
  - Feed-forward networks  
  - Language acceptance tasks  
- Final model accepts input and classifies language patterns
